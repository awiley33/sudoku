# Sudoku Generator
---
This is a program which generates a valid 9x9 Sudoku puzzle. 

A valid Sudoku puzzle must have numbers 1-9 exactly once in all 9 of each of the following configurations:
- 3x3 grid
- row
- column

This project is currently a **work in progress**. I will update the documentation once completed. This project started out as a prompt I was given during a technical interview, and I am chipping away at solving it in my free time.

Thanks for stopping by :wave:
